## About The Project

Did you know there is more in your belly button than lint!

This repository breaks down a study of belly button biodiversity! 

Use your terminal to create a local host website that visualizes the microbs present in human navels. Change the ID number to see an updated bar chart for the top 10 microbs, a bubble chart breakdown of all microbs, and a table displaying the demographic info of the individual linked to the chosen ID number!
